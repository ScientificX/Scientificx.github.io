Well many people say it was hard , tough and all such synonyms. I say this is life, survival, endurance and winning the fight
God showing his hand and mercies definitely did make it easier for me - /His Reckless love/. 

Well thinking back i did acheive quite a lot in 2020 in all areas

+ I definitely became more mature
+ I completed the 2nd Year of my Electrical Engineering degree at Covenant University
+ I did becomem a better developer
+ On my way to stopping that bad habit ....
+ Co-organised the hult Prize Competion at my university
+ Decided to study programming and cs by taking a more ground up approach rather than rush to learn the new shiny framework

** On To 2021
   A new and the transition provides a perfect opportunity for reflection on one's life noting improvement areas
   and for me those are
  + Curbing my technology
  + Finishing one thing completely before moving on to the next - /Commiting to a master of some rather than a jack of all trades/
  + Since i have many hobbies, maintaning a bucket list of all things i want to do before i die sorted in order of priority
  + A deeper walk with jesus
  + Commiting to using blogging as a means of journaling and following a task/idea to completion(Increasing Acountability)
  + Avoid wasting time
